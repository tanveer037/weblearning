        <p>Most beef can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts,
            such as <span class="types">roasts</span> , <span class="types">short ribs</span> or <span
                class="types">steak</span> (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger
            steak, etc.),
            while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky).
            <b>Trimmings,</b> on the other hand, which are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore
            tougher)
            cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.
            The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage.
            Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal,
            such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and
            thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of
            bovine
            spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender
            testicles
            of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some
            intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The
            bones
            are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <hr>

            The word beef is from the Latin bōs, in contrast to cow which is from Middle English cou (both words have
            the
            same Indo-European root *gʷou-). After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England
            naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served. Thus, various Anglo-Saxon words were
            used
            for
            the animal (such as nēat, or cu for adult females) by the peasants, but the meat was called boef (ox)
            (Modern
            French
            bœuf) by the French nobles — who did not often deal with the live animal — when it was served to them. This
            is
            one
            example of the common English dichotomy between the words for animals (with largely Germanic origins) and
            their
            meat
            (with Romanic origins) that is also found in such English word-pairs as pig/pork, deer/venison, sheep/mutton
            and
            chicken/poultry (also the less common goat/chevon). Beef is cognate with bovine through the Late Latin
            bovīnus. The rarely used plural form of beef is beeves.

            <h2>Cuts</h2>
            <hr>
    
            Beef is first divided into primal cuts, large pieces of the animal initially separated by butchering. These are
            basic sections from which steaks and other subdivisions are cut. The term "primal cut" is quite different from
            "prime cut", used to characterize cuts considered to be of higher quality. Since the animal's legs and neck
            muscles
            do the most work, they are the toughest; the meat becomes more tender as distance from hoof and horn increases.
            Different countries and cuisines have different cuts and names, and sometimes use the same name for a different
            cut;
            for example, the cut described as "brisket" in the United States is from a significantly different part of the
            carcass than British brisket.
